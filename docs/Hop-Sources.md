Links to a few websites which list some additional hops varieties not yet in the db

[Hopslist](http://www.hopslist.com/hops/)

[Hopsteiner](https://www.hopsteiner.com/variety-data-sheets/)

Where there is a discrepancy in data, for example difference alpha-acid ranges, data from Hopsteiner is being preferentially used.

Hopslist generally provides Style information.

Both can provide Substitute information.
